# vanillaJS-cloneSite
This site made with pure javascript, not using js libary, and it's not responsive web-site.
After finishing this project, I could feel the needs of JS library ( REACT ),   
because there were so many repetitive components and wasted code.   
These things made it difficult to progress code.
